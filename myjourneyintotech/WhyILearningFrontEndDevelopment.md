# Why I'm learning Front-End Development?
Once you begin your profession, it is quite easy to grow complacent. You've just completed a 20-year period in which all you were intended to do was learn, and it might be difficult to restart the engine once you've stopped.

Hopefully, you have a work that challenges you and requires you to learn and acquire new abilities on a regular basis. However, for many people, a job consists of repeating the same activities over and again, providing them with opportunities to learn to do something exceptionally well while excluding them from new experiences.

With the rapid development of front-end technology, I am thrilled that my industry requires me to keep learning. That would be a lot of great opportunities to learn new things.

I studied Software Development & Network Engineering at Sheridan College. I learnt how to research, design, deploy, configure, troubleshoot, maintain, upgrade the applications. Besides that, I learnt how to approach a problem, how to conduct a SWOT analysis and find the solution, and how to improve my "communication skills" when collaborating with others. The program has taught me a lot of things that have helped me in my work and personal life, but it still has a lot of new technology skills to learn.

Finally, and most importantly, front-end programming is an excellent complement to user experience design. A modern cognitive process that I'm interested in learning more about after taking User Experience Design course. Understanding what you can and cannot do when creating a website (and assisting with implementation) is a huge assistance when it comes to the appearance and flow of the site.
